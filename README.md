Calculate surface tension of a "football" shape of actin clustering using MC simulation

`fb_ver1_1.cpp` is the version I used to create the snapshot for 10 billion accepted moves.

To visualize xyz trajectory file, you can use [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) (Visual Molecular Dynamics), which is open source. Create a username and password to register for the first download.
There's a sample xyz file (VMD0.60L5-run1-id-2-split-5.xyz), you can use it together with `VMD basics for xyz file.pdf` to viualize the output after the simulation.
