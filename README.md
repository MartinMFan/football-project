Calculate the surface tension of a "football" shape of actin clustering using MC simulation

To visualize xyz trajectory file, you can use [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) (Visual Molecular Dynamics), which is open source. Create a username and password to register for the first download.
There's a sample xyz file [VMD0.60L5-run1-id-2-split-5.xyz](docs/examples/VMD0.60L5-run1-id-2-split-5.xyz), you can use it together with [VMD basics for xyz file.pdf](docs/VMD_basics_for_xyz_file.pdf) to visualize the output after the simulation.
